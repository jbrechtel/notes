### Silverlight XAP files

Silverlight apps are deployed as XAP files. XAP files are just zip files...you can unzip them directly.

Also, any XAML files are stored in the DLLs (as resources ostensibly) as plain text...can be crudely copied out. Probably better tools for this, but it worked for me in a pinch
